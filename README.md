### Introduction:
In this project, we are going to do a comparative analysis of some major
classification algorithms, (i.e: Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support
Vector Machine) on a dataset. We use a dataset from Kaggle. The algorithms are
implemented in python using the scikit-learn library and also in weka3.8 tool. We
also evaluated the performances of the algorithms using accuracy, precision, recall,
f1-score etc. performance measure metrics. A comprehensive and supportive
discussion is included to justify the results of the classification algorithms. The
dataset holds some medical insurance data. We wanted to classify if an individual
is a ‘Smoker’ or not based on the other information of the dataset. We have
implemented the four above mentioned classification algorithms to generate a
comparative study of their performance.
