# Classification-Algorithms-DT-RF-NB-SVM-Using-Python

Some classification algorithms e.g: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector machine are performed on an Insurance dataset from kaggle. Python is used to implement the algorithms. Along with the implementation of the algorithms, there is a report attached containing comparative analysis of the algorithms implemented on the dataset depending on the result that is found.
